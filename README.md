# Funds_Distribution_Project_PowerBI

## Problem:
To analyze funds distribution for Pakistan Young Hindu Forum (NGO) for the 2023 calendar year with respect to the location and area of focus. 

## Description:
Pakistan Young Hindu Forum is an NGO which works mainly for poverty alleviation for the Hindus of Pakistan. For the upcoming year, PYHF aims to minimize their misspends in funds and divert their focus to those areas which are highly populated with Hindu communities.   
             

## Results:  
More than 90% of the Hindu population lives in Sindh province.
Around 9 lac population of Hindus reside in Mirpurkhas Division which encompasses Islamkot, Mithi and Mirpurkhas city. 
Most NGOs in the MirpurKhas region work for a blood donation drive and Domestic Violence. 

## Recommendations: 
This report shows that majority of the region of the Mirpukhas division is deprived of focussed educational NGOs. It is highly recommended that PYHF should divert their funds related to education facilities, e.g. providing merit scholarships and global exposure.
